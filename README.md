Single and Multi-Agent AI Workflow
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build both single-agent and multi-agent workflows for AI-powered tasks using LangChain, DuckDuckGo search, and the Euriai LLM. Agents can research, write articles, or combine multiple tools to accomplish complex objectives autonomously.

Features
Single-Agent Example: Use one AI agent to complete a specific task (like searching the web or generating text).
Multi-Agent Collaboration: Coordinate multiple agents (e.g., a researcher and a writer) to perform sequential or parallel tasks.
Web Search Tool: Integrate real-time search functionality (using DuckDuckGo) as a tool for agents.
Euriai LLM Integration: Use the Euriai API as your LLM for generating text instead of OpenAI.
